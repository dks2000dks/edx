We're going to demonstrate how to change the background wallpaper on a Red Hat 7 system.
All recent Linux distributions have exactly the same method, so this will suffice to show for all.
So, all we have to do is click on the background with a right-click and [choose] "Change Background".
Click on "Background" again, and then we have a choice between wallpapers that the system knows already.
And it's possible to load up other ones. So, let's say we pick this one here and you see now the background has been changed.
Or I could pick for instance a picture stored on my machine in my pictures directory, under my home directory.
So, I'll pick this one and you see it's been changed.
So that's all we have to do to change the background on any recent Linux system.
