Let&#39;s now demonstrate how to set default applications on a Red Hat 7 system.

1
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:13,760
We go to the upper right hand corner, click on the top bar, and then scroll down to the gears icon for settings.

2
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,840
Go down to the bottom for Details.

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:26,500
And then I can click on Default Applications. So, you see, under Web or Browser, there are three choices on this system.

4
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:31,780
I have Google Chrome, Firefox or Opera. We&#39;ll leave it at Google Chrome.

5
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:42,680
For video, the default choice is Videos, which is actually a program called Totem. Well, let&#39;s switch it to the VLC media player.

6
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:51,480
And for the image viewer, I have the built-in Image Viewer, or I could  switch to the GNU Image Manipulation Program, better known as GIMP.

7
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:59,940
So, on all recent distributions with a GNOME desktop, the procedure is identical and absolutely the same.

8
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,040
It is very simple to change your default applications.
