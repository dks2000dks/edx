00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:09,580
We are now going to demonstrate software package management from a graphical interface using the openSUSE Linux distribution.

1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:17,620
The tool we want to use for doing this is YaST, y-s-t, and there&#39;s two different ways I can reach it.

2
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:27,160
If I have the GNOME shell extension installed which shows the Applications menu, which doesn&#39;t come by default, I can go down to System Tools,

3
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:35,620
and then go down to YaST, or I can always go up to the upper right hand corner, click on the Tool icon,

4
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:46,320
and then, at the bottom here, on the system, click on YaST. It will want the root password because I&#39;m going to manipulate what&#39;s installed on the system.

5
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,280
And so, if I go Software, I can go to Software Management.

6
00:00:53,120 --> 00:01:01,660
Now, the first thing that YaST has to do is study the system and get a database of every possible package.

7
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:07,040
So, you can look at the packages on the system in different ways.

8
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:15,300
You can look by what&#39;s called RPM Groups. So, here&#39;s all the Games, grouped under Amusements.

9
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:24,520
I have Applications, Development, and all different kinds of Development subcategories, Tools, Documentation, etc.

10
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:30,220
Or RPM Groups... No, this is RPM Groups. Okay...

11
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:35,080
Or, I can look at Package Groups, which maybe is a little more intuitive.

12
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:42,460
So, I could click on, let&#39;s say, Multimedia and see all the different programs that are involved in dealing with multimedia.

13
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:52,580
Suppose I want to install something or inquire as to where something is installed. I can click on Search and type something in here.

14
00:01:52,580 --> 00:02:03,600
I&#39;ll type gnuplot and I bring up quickly all the different gnuplot programs there are.

15
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,940
The main one, you see, has a check mark in the box. That means it&#39;s already installed.

16
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:18,480
I will decide to install gnuplot-doc, which is a small documentation package.

17
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:28,360
And then, in order to do the install, I will click on Accept and I will go ahead and do it. It&#39;s a pretty small package. It doesn&#39;t take long.

18
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,560
If you needed some other packages to function, it would have installed them at the same time.

19
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:40,980
So now, I&#39;ll say Continue, and if I can, I want to remove it because I don&#39;t really need it.

20
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:57,240
I&#39;ll type it in the Search again and then I click on here until I get an X for removal. And then I say Accept and it&#39;s removing it.

21
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:10,490
So that&#39;s all I have to do to do some basic package installation and removal under GNOME software with openSUSE. Pretty simple.
