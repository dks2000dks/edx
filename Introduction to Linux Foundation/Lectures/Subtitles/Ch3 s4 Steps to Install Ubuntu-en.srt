00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,160
Now, we&#39;re going to do an install of Ubuntu 18.04 as a virtual machine under the VMware hypervisor, using a Red Hat 7 host system running VMware Player.

1
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:20,660
So, the first thing we need to do is to create a new virtual machine,

2
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:32,640
and for that, I already have the Ubuntu install disk mounted in the virtual CD drive,

3
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:42,840
and we&#39;ll give a name for the user as &quot;LF Student&quot; for the username of &quot;student&quot;.

4
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,700
Now, we have to give a password, which I have done.

5
00:00:48,700 --> 00:01:04,920
And then, for the name, let&#39;s just call it &quot;Ubuntu&quot;, and then, on the host machine, I want to have a certain place I want to put it rather than my home directory, I want it on a disk that has a lot of space.

6
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:17,040
And then, let&#39;s allocate 30 gigabytes of space, and I prefer to have it as one big file rather than multiple files or slices.

7
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,260
I find that clutters my system less.

8
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:26,660
And really, that&#39;s all you have to do this start setting up the install,

9
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:35,480
but it&#39;s better to click on &quot;Customize hardware&quot; and increase the amount of memory from 1 gigabyte to 4 in my case.

10
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:44,620
and I might as well take advantage of having multiple processors, so I&#39;ll let it use all 4 processors on this host machine.

11
00:01:44,620 --> 00:02:01,760
And then, I&#39;ll just click on &quot;Finish&quot;, and it will start the install after a couple of harmless messages about how the virtual machine graphics driver doesn&#39;t permit accelerated graphics performance.

12
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:16,160
Now, the beautiful thing about the Ubuntu install on this recent version is that I am done. There are no more choices to make. I don&#39;t have any more parameters to specify, etc.

13
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:32,400
If I hadn&#39;t been installing in a virtual machine, it would have asked me information like user name and password at this stage, but it was able to pick that up because of the intelligent way that VMware can handle Ubuntu.

14
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:48,220
So, I&#39;m doing this in real time. You know, if you can read the messages, you see it just created the main filesystem on the system, and now it&#39;s going through the stage of copying all the files over to the hard disk.

15
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,330
Or, I should say, the simulated hard disk.

16
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:59,240
Now, this takes a little bit of time. So, I&#39;ll pause the recording for a few seconds, so you don&#39;t have to watch not much happening.

17
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:16,540
It skipped about a minute or so, and now it says it&#39;s almost finished copying files. It&#39;s showing a bunch of different blurbs for various features in this bionic beaver, or Ubuntu 18.04 release.

18
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:24,380
The status bar has reached all the way to the right so it should be almost done.

19
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:35,639
And now it&#39;s doing the actual install of the system. So, it&#39;s copied all the files it needs over to the hard disk, and it&#39;s doing the actual configuration.

20
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:47,760
So, once again, I believe I&#39;ll pause for a little while, so you don&#39;t have to sit here and watch not much happening.

21
00:03:47,760 --> 00:04:02,420
I paused for about a minute. Now it says it&#39;s configuring hardware. So, it&#39;s finding all the hardware devices in the system, making sure it has the right device drivers for it, etc.

22
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:14,080
It&#39;s now configuring the bootloader, the GRUB, and now it&#39;s doing cleanup - it&#39;s getting rid of packages which were only needed during the install.

23
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:25,860
Then, of course, that&#39;s rolling by far too fast to be readable.

24
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:37,040
And so, it&#39;s doing a little bit more package installation.

25
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:48,560
And I&#39;ll pause again for a little while. There, it reached the end of the status bar and now it&#39;s doing a reboot.

26
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,680
And shortly, I should be getting a login prompt.

27
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:17,320
If you noticed, it&#39;s installing open-vm-tools. That&#39;s a package of special drivers and configuration stuff that&#39;s used when you&#39;re running it as a guest under VMware hypervisor.

28
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:37,770
And we&#39;ve reached the login screen running under the greater. So, I&#39;ll just log in as student and ops, I typed in the wrong password, I suppose... yep.

29
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:52,300
And now the system is running. There&#39;s a few introductory messages here, and I&#39;ll just click through them to get to a fully up system, and then,

30
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:58,039
just to see what really happened here, if I right-click, I can open up a terminal.

31
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:10,880
And then, I&#39;m gonna run the command &quot;df&quot;, for disk free, &quot;- t&quot; to show me what type of filesystems I have, and &quot;h&quot; to print out the results in megabytes and gigabytes [df -th].

32
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:21,880
And I see that in the main filesystem I have 30 gigabytes of space, of which I&#39;m using 5.3, and it&#39;s an ext4 filesystem.

33
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:33,060
When we install CentOS, we need to actually specify the type of filesystem, the size of the partition, etc. but Ubuntu made choices that it thought were best.

34
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:48,400
Likewise, we won&#39;t talk about this now, but if I look at swap files, you&#39;ll see that there is a swap file of about one and a half gigabytes created instead of a swap partition.

35
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,880
Usually, distributions create swap partitions.

36
00:06:51,880 --> 00:07:03,520
So, that&#39;s all there is to install the latest version of Ubuntu. Absolutely nothing to do during install - it makes what it thinks is sensible decisions for everything.

37
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:12,580
And after the system is up and running, you can then go into the package manager and put in exactly what you need and configure the system in other ways.

38
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:24,440
If you need a more flexible installation to begin with, you can make such choices when you start, but we took the easy path here.
