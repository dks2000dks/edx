00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:10,780
We are now going to demonstrate basic software package management on a CentOS 7 system using a graphical interface.

1
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:16,060
The easiest way to do this is to go through the Applications menu in the upper left corner.

2
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:22,180
Scroll down to System Tools, and then go over to Software.

3
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:29,340
And this lists the different kinds of software that&#39;s on the system, organized by category.

4
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,640
It&#39;s a pretty minimal interface, but quite useful.

5
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:40,040
So, for instance, on desktops, you see, I could have GNOME, KDE, Xfce, etc.

6
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,220
There are different possibilities.

7
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:47,280
And these are the packages that are associated with these different desktops.

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:56,640
If I want to search for a particular kind of package, let&#39;s say I&#39;ll look at gnuplot, g-n-u-p-l-o-t

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:07,500
it&#39;s searching the database on the system, and it found here, with the check marks, I have already installed gnuplot and gnuplot-common.

10
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:13,900
Suppose I want to install the documentation package, which is a simple but small package...

11
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:21,290
So here, gnuplot-doc, so I clicked on that, I said Apply Changes...

12
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:31,660
it&#39;s asking me for the root password because I&#39;m installing software, and then it did that very quickly... it&#39;s a very small package.

13
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:43,909
And if I want to remove it, then I can just uncheck the box here now, and click Apply Changes,

14
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:52,860
and it&#39;s going to ask me to okay that is what I really wanted to do...

15
00:01:52,860 --> 00:02:01,220
If you&#39;re required any other software packages to be removed at the same time, it would let me know about that now,

16
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:09,000
just as when I installed it, if it required other software packages to be installed to enable this to run, it would have told me that too.

17
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,860
So I just say Continue. Once again, it&#39;s asking me for the super user password, and it&#39;s done.

18
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:27,640
So that&#39;s all you have to do to easily install or remove just a single package on the system from a graphical interface.
