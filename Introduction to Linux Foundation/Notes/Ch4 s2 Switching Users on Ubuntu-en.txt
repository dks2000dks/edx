Let us demonstrate how to switch users on an Ubuntu machine with several accounts.
So first, I will choose the Linux Foundation student as the account to log into, type my password, and sign in.
And then, if I look in the upper right hand corner and click there, I will see LF Student and I can click on either "Log Out" or "Switch User".
Notice if I log out, I really log out, but if I switch users, I will just lock the user account, and then, when I start up, I will preserve all of my sessions and open windows, etc. when I restart.
On some distributions you may actually see a list of users at this screen, but not on Ubuntu.
So I'll say "Switch User" and I'm back to the greeter screen, and let me pick the second one, Theodore Cleaver, and login as that other user.
And there we go. And now, if I look up here again, I can do the same thing. So, let me click on the name, I'll say "Switch User",
and if I pick student again, you'll notice here it says "Unlock", and not "Restart". That means that, if I were to login now, I will have preserved all the open windows and running applications from before.
This will look the same essentially on all Linux distributions of recent vintage. So it's very easy to switch users and not lose any information from what you're already doing.
