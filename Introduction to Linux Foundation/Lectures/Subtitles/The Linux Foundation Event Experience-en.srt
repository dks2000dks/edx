00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,085
There is no other event like it anywhere on the planet, period.

1
00:00:10,086 --> 00:00:15,847
So much energy and ideas are embraced. The community and the enthusiasm, is just amazing.

2
00:00:15,848 --> 00:00:19,623
This is the end all, be all; number one that I look forward to each year.

3
00:00:19,624 --> 00:00:29,534
Linux foundation events are unique because it's a place where the developers of the industry and community meet real-time to make real technical decisions.

4
00:00:29,535 --> 00:00:34,477
It's a lot of very high value and influential people in the open source community.

5
00:00:34,478 --> 00:00:39,534
And it's a great way to take a litmus test of what the Linux community has to offer.

6
00:00:39,535 --> 00:00:45,307
Speakers say things here that they will not say anywhere else.

7
00:00:45,308 --> 00:00:52,212
The Linux foundation events are just a good exchange between the industry and the community.

8
00:00:52,338 --> 00:01:01,328
The most important thing about Linux and other free and open source software development is the collaboration between human beings.

9
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:05,029
We work better when we know the people we are working with.

10
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:08,481
The networking opportunities have been fantastic.

11
00:01:08,482 --> 00:01:13,847
You get a lot more done in a couple of days than you do all years just in exchanging emails and phone calls.

12
00:01:13,848 --> 00:01:20,777
A lot of different opportunities to both communicate with people that you already know and to meet some people who might have different perspectives.

13
00:01:20,778 --> 00:01:25,198
I think that the overlap of Linux Con and Cloud Open is bringing (you know)

14
00:01:25,199 --> 00:01:28,924
a good group of different people together to kind of collaborate and have interesting conversations.

15
00:01:28,925 --> 00:01:33,445
I think that's a unique aspect of this conference that we don't get anywhere else.

16
00:01:33,446 --> 00:01:38,661
One of my favorite things about Linux con is that it is always in a different city.

17
00:01:38,662 --> 00:01:41,791
You get a little bit of the experience of wherever you are.

18
00:01:41,792 --> 00:01:47,081
Linux foundation events are really fun events with a really interesting mix of people.

19
00:01:47,082 --> 00:01:53,316
In New Orleans, we had the floats it was like being in a New Orleans parade, out on the streets, in house with the blues.

20
00:01:53,317 --> 00:01:57,539
The parties sometimes are more effective than the sessions that the truth.

21
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:03,599
It's a time for people to build a relationship so that they can work even more effectively down the line.

22
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,983
If you want to help shape the future of the products and services that you are consuming it's a great place

23
00:02:09,984 --> 00:02:15,125
to give input to the people who are creating your next generation of technology.

24
00:02:15,126 --> 00:02:20,167
Your world will change with each person that you meet; everyone's open.

25
00:02:20,168 --> 00:02:24,042
They are sharing the opportunity for you to learn about what they are doing.

26
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:24,837
It's exciting!

27
00:02:24,838 --> 00:02:27,097
Lots of people lots of interaction. Great community.

28
00:02:27,098 --> 00:02:28,364
It's a bit of everything.

29
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:29,979
Geeky happiness!
