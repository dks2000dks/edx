00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:09,760
So, let's do some basic package management on an Ubuntu system using Debian packaging.

1
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:16,380
We're going to use the high-level utilities which understand dependencies: apt-cache and apt-get.

2
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:35,200
So, first, let's look for all packages that contain the string wget2. So we do that with apt-cache search wget2, and it comes up with wget2 and wget2-dev.

3
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:47,620
This is an enhancement to the standard wget utility, which is used for recursive downloading of the content of a website or some other kinds of resources.

4
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:58,250
So, let's just try an install. So, do sudo apt-get install wget2-dev.

5
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:06,220
And it's telling me it also needs to install libwget0 and wget2.

6
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:14,460
It shouldn't be that surprising that you need to install the base packages on which the development packages build on.

7
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:24,509
And it will download 264 kB of archives, but once everything is installed, it will expand out to 805 kB.

8
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:31,300
So, let's just say yes. I'll type y. And it quickly goes ahead and does all that.

9
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:47,000
Now, suppose we want to remove wget2-dev. Or, more interesting, let's try to remove wget itself.

10
00:01:47,619 --> 00:01:57,420
So, what is it doing? Oh, I shouldn't have removed wget. I meant wget2. wget I do not want to remove. So, I'll type it again with the 2.

11
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:08,620
And you see, it wants to remove wget2-dev as well, because without wget2, wget2-dev doesn't have much meaning.

12
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:17,600
Ok and we no longer need the libwget0. It's sort of orphaned out, but we'll leave it there for now.

13
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:24,740
So, I'll just say yes and I have removed things from my system.

14
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:34,820
So, that's the most basic operations you would need to do on an Ubuntu system using Debian packaging.
