00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:10,000
We are now going to do a fresh install of openSUSE as a virtual machine under a  VMware hypervisor on a Red Hat 7 system.

1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,980
We have already inserted the install DVD, and we are about to begin.

2
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:29,660
Notice that in our initial screen we can do an installation, an upgrade, or, if we scroll down to more, we see that we can also use the install DVD as a rescue system.

3
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:42,860
We can check memory and do various things, but we&#39;re going to do an install. So, I&#39;ll just click on &quot;Install&quot;, and then, it will cook for a while before it asks me to do anything.

4
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:51,680
So now it&#39;s finding all the hardware, deciding what drivers to use, etc. and getting started.

5
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:58,300
This is openSUSE Leap version 42.3.

6
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:10,220
And this is a typical GNOME graphical booting screen while it&#39;s getting itself ready,

7
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,280
which should take a few more seconds...

8
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,460
I&#39;ll pause so we don&#39;t have to watch the whole thing...

9
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:29,570
okay, it has moved on and it&#39;s about ready to bring up a graphical screen. And there we go.

10
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,440
So, it&#39;s initializing the hardware on the system.

11
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:48,560
Okay... now it&#39;s asking whether we want to accept English as a language and also the License Agreement. So, we&#39;ll just say sure. Click on the &quot;Next&quot; button.

12
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,640
It&#39;s doing more probing of the system, deciding what to do...

13
00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:07,700
And it says in a very small font &quot;Initializing the installation&quot;. Now, it would like to take a default partition scheme, which we will override.

14
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:16,220
So, let me say &quot;Edit proposed settings&quot;. And I will take a partition-based proposal.

15
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:30,020
I will choose for my root partition ext4. I won&#39;t have any separate home partition or other partitions to keep things simple. And that&#39;s all I have to choose. It&#39;s pretty simple.

16
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:46,579
And it says here it&#39;s going to create a swap partition of 2 gigabytes and then a root partition for everything else - 28 gigabytes. And so, I&#39;m happy enough with that. So, I&#39;ll just say &quot;Next&quot;.

17
00:02:51,740 --> 00:03:00,120
And first thing is just to pick the timezone. So, I&#39;ll pick Central Time, where I am currently sitting.

18
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:11,420
And I could do some other settings... do that unless I don&#39;t want to take an automatic time setting... so I just say &quot;Next&quot;.

19
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:26,400
And here I have a choice for what kind of desktop... let me pick the GNOME desktop... I could pick the KDE or as a server - pure text mode, no graphical, or I could do custom, to do something a little more complicated or different.

20
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:40,260
And then it wants me to give a full name for the main user. So, I&#39;ll say &quot;LF Student&quot;, and for the username I&#39;ll pick &quot;student&quot; and I&#39;ll give a password.

21
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:47,580
And then, I will not pick &quot;Use this password for system administrator&quot;. That would be like what Ubuntu does.

22
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:55,260
And I will not pick &quot;Automatic login&quot;. It&#39;s generally not a good idea to let your system log in without having to give a password.

23
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:06,880
So, I&#39;ll say &quot;Next&quot;. It doesn&#39;t like my password because it&#39;s too simple, but I&#39;ll say &quot;okay, do it&quot;, and now I have to give a root password.

24
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:14,600
And you might want to test your keyboard layout, to make sure you have the right language. I&#39;ll say &quot;Next&quot;.

25
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:25,260
And, once again, it&#39;s gonna complain my password is too simple. And then I just say &quot;Install&quot; and that&#39;s all the choices that I actually have to make.

26
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:33,100
So really nothing except specifying username, password and what kind of desktop I want.

27
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,800
We can do further adjustments once the system is fully installed.

28
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:52,360
Now, while it&#39;s installing, which should take about 10 minutes, the default screen here is a slideshow giving you brochures and information. And if I click on &quot;Details&quot;, it&#39;s a little more fun to look at.

29
00:04:52,360 --> 00:05:05,040
So, you can see the overall progress as it goes. This first bar here is for each package as it&#39;s being installed and on the bottom you can see I&#39;m already about 15% installed.

30
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:15,360
So, I&#39;m going to pause recording. This is kind of boring to watch install all 1,500 packages on a wait until it&#39;s asking me to do something again before resuming.

31
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:25,100
Okay, that took about less than 10 minutes and now it&#39;s telling me the system is going to reboot and it did.

32
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:33,760
And so we&#39;ll just see our normal booting of the new openSUSE system.

33
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,060
And it should quickly bring up the login screen.

34
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,640
Just a few more seconds...

35
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:11,280
And there&#39;s our usual greeter screen. I&#39;ll just type in the password for the &quot;student&quot; account and we have a fully operational openSUSE system.

36
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:24,180
Now, the first thing I would do from here is update the system, because there&#39;s always new updates for the various packages since the DVD install disk was released.

37
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:38,440
So that&#39;s important for both security and performance. And it&#39;s even prompting me to go ahead and do that. And I&#39;d probably do some minor customizations about what kind of menus I see, how windows behave, the keyboard. etc.

38
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:44,000
But I&#39;ll leave that for people to do that as an exercise.
