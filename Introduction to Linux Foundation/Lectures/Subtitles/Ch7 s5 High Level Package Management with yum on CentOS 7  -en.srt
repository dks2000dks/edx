Let&#39;s demonstrate basic high-level package management operations from the command line on a CentOS 7 system using yum.

1
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:28,860
So, first let&#39;s use &quot;sudo yum list&quot; all packages which have bzip2 in their names, the string bzip2 in their names [sudo yum list &quot;*bzip2*&quot;].

2
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:40,620
The reason I&#39;m putting this in quotes is in case there&#39;s any files in the directory with bzip2, and then it will pick that up instead of what&#39;s called globbing in the package list.

3
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:49,740
So, you see first it lists the packages which are installed, which are the normal bzip2 packages, and some libraries associated with it,

4
00:00:49,740 --> 00:01:03,280
and then, what&#39;s not installed under Available Packages - you see packages for the 32-bit architecture i686, for instance, but there&#39;s also something called lbzip2.

5
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:14,880
So, let&#39;s find out what that actually is. So, if I do &quot;yum info lbzip2&quot;, and once again I have to do sudo [sudo yum info lbzip2],

6
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:23,900
it&#39;s telling me it&#39;s an independent multi-threaded implementation of bzip2, which I happen to know runs much, much faster,

7
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:35,040
because, for instance, if you have 8 processors or 4 processors, it can use them all at once instead of just having one cranking along. So, it can do a lot of parallel work.

8
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:43,920
Ok, you&#39;ll notice that these are stored in the epel repository, which stands for Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux.

9
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:57,160
These are things which are not in the standard Red Hat repositories, but generally are in Fedora, and can be installed usually without problem on a CentOS 7 or a Red Hat 7 system.

10
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:08,480
So, let&#39;s install that and, to show you how dependencies work, let&#39;s not install lbzip2, but let&#39;s install lbzip2-utils.

11
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:26,580
So, &quot;sudo yum install lbzip2-utils&quot;... you see, it&#39;s telling me that, in order to install lbzip2-utils, I also have to install lbzip2, because it depends on it.

12
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:35,100
Well, that makes perfect sense. It&#39;s not very big. It&#39;s only 127KB download. So, it goes very quickly when I say yes.

13
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:50,820
And, if I want to see more information now that it&#39;s installed, I could do something like this: &quot;rpm qil lbzip2&quot;, and once again, I don&#39;t really have to do sudo, but I&#39;ll do it.

14
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:57,160
And I get the same information I had from info, but also a file list.

15
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:02,640
So, you see the executables are lbunzip2, lbzcat, and lbzip2.

16
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,320
Now, suppose I want to remove this package. How would I do that?

17
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:17,520
Well, I could say &quot;sudo yum remove lbzip2&quot;. Let&#39;s see what happens.

18
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:29,740
Well, it&#39;s telling me if I remove that, then I&#39;d better remove lbzip2-utils because that needs lbzip2, so it&#39;s going to remove both at the same time, otherwise,

19
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:34,739
whatever is in lbzip2-utils will no longer work, so let&#39;s do that.

20
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:43,609
And that&#39;s just a very quick demonstration of some of the basic things we do all the time using yum.
