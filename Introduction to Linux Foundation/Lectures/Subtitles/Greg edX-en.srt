Hi, my name is Greg Kroah-Hartman. I work with the Linux foundation as a fellow.

1
00:00:07,345 --> 00:00:11,898
I am a Linux kernel developer. I release stable Linux kernels as well as doing (do) other driver development.

2
00:00:11,899 --> 00:00:16,902
Linux releases development kernel about once every three months, I do the stable kernels about once every week.

3
00:00:16,903 --> 00:00:21,143
I got involved with Linux many years ago. I used to use it where I worked.

4
00:00:21,144 --> 00:00:25,584
I was a programmer. I invented embedded devices, firmware for embedded devices.

5
00:00:25,585 --> 00:00:33,053
I had to interact my devices with all sorts of operating systems. Linux was just coming around. It was just getting USB support.

6
00:00:33,054 --> 00:00:35,943
I was just creating a USB device. I had to get it to work.

7
00:00:35,944 --> 00:00:40,122
I had contributed a patch to make the change and it was accepted and I was like hey, that's great!

8
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:43,700
Over time I submitted more and more patches and I wrote a driver for a device which

9
00:00:43,701 --> 00:00:46,702
Linux didn't support because I was using Linux on my own desktop.

10
00:00:46,703 --> 00:00:51,569
Suddenly, over time I realized that more people were using my device for free than

11
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,422
anything that I ever got paid for because the companies that I worked for never did very well.

12
00:00:55,423 --> 00:00:59,526
And dot com boom started and there was more and more need for Linux developers.

13
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:04,280
I got a job being a Linux kernel developer full-time and I haven't looked back since.

14
00:01:04,281 --> 00:01:07,433
It's been a great great opportunity and I really enjoy doing this.

15
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:12,562
Linux is an operating system and its core is just a kernel. It talks to the hardware makes the hardware work.

16
00:01:12,563 --> 00:01:16,015
It makes it able for you to run programs and do what you want to do.

17
00:01:16,016 --> 00:01:23,021
It's very unique in the fact that there are lots of other operating systems out there but our development community is very different.

18
00:01:23,022 --> 00:01:29,101
We have over 2000 developers every year contributing to it from over 400 may be 500 companies.

19
00:01:29,102 --> 00:01:33,705
It is the single largest software project in the history of mankind.

20
00:01:33,706 --> 00:01:40,961
We contribute at the rate of about (what are we) about ten patches a day, twenty four hours a day, seven days a week, go into this code.

21
00:01:40,962 --> 00:01:45,215
It's constantly updated, constantly revised, constantly changing because the world changes.

22
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:52,196
We have to react to a change in world. If an operating system stops change and of course if the world doesn't stop changing it will die.

23
00:01:52,197 --> 00:01:57,275
Linux constantly is improved, constantly is updated in order to handle the changing world.

24
00:01:57,276 --> 00:02:02,329
The more you know about Linux the better off you can be. Linux is used everywhere and we need help using it.

25
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:09,460
There is almost no part of the world that does not use Linux. If you have skills in Linux we have tons of jobs out there.

26
00:02:09,461 --> 00:02:13,439
We need people who are programmers, we need people who are sys admins, we need people to document the stuff,

27
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,244
we need people to test the stuff and it's a fun thing to play with. You can play with it and create things out of it.

28
00:02:19,245 --> 00:02:21,045
So you also can have fun while you are doing it.

29
00:02:21,046 --> 00:02:25,399
And it will help feel that you are part of a larger community that's doing something great.

30
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:30,704
This course will teach the fundamentals of what Linux is; how to use the command line; how to use the graphical interface.

31
00:02:30,705 --> 00:02:35,783
It is self-guided; you can sign up for it at anytime and take it at your own pace. Thank you for your interest in Linux.

32
00:02:35,784 --> 00:02:41,488
I hope you enjoy the course. Linux is a wonderful experience. It provides great opportunities for jobs,

33
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:45,784
for future, for creating new and wonderful devices. I hope you enjoy this.
