Let's get started with how to navigate through the directory history using the command prompt.

1
00:00:06,086 --> 00:00:17,805
1. Let us say, we have two directories named dir1 and dir2 created under tmp directory and the current working directory is the test3's home directory.

2
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:30,774
2. To change from test3's home directory to dir1 under tmp directory, at the command prompt type cd /tmp/dir1 and press Enter.

3
00:00:31,314 --> 00:00:37,389
3. To push the current directory to stack type pushd. and press Enter.

4
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,936
Now you working directory is dir1.

5
00:00:41,085 --> 00:00:51,741
4. Now To change to dir2 under tmp directory, at the command prompt type cd /tmp/dir2 and press Enter.

6
00:00:52,291 --> 00:00:55,585
Now you working directory is dir2.

7
00:00:56,171 --> 00:01:01,183
5. To push the current directory to stack, type pushd. and press Enter.

8
00:01:01,497 --> 00:01:05,773
Now, the stack contains the details of the last two directories that you have pushed.

9
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:12,023
6. To view the directories in the stack, at the command prompt type dirs and press Enter.

10
00:01:12,748 --> 00:01:16,100
You can see the names of the two directories you have pushed to the stack

11
00:01:16,835 --> 00:01:24,473
7. To pop the top-most directory from the stack, at the command prompt type popd and press Enter.

12
00:01:24,658 --> 00:01:30,970
8. To check the current working directory, at the command prompt type pwd and press Enter.

13
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:37,483
9. To pop the top-most directory from the stack, at the command prompt type popd and press Enter.

14
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:43,270
10. To check the current working directory, at the command prompt type pwd and press Enter.

15
00:01:43,753 --> 00:01:47,603
Now you're working directory is changed to dir1

16
00:01:47,768 --> 00:01:53,772
11. To pop the top-most directory from the stack, at the command prompt type popd and press Enter.

17
00:01:53,926 --> 00:01:57,462
Since, no entries are available in the stack you get a notification
